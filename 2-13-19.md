## Questionnaires:
- Trying to prove something: observation experiments
	- observing takes up a lot more time than quick quizzes
	- observing can speed up videos to see changes
	- differences in expected outcomes/different perspectives
	- observation desired
	- knowledge of observation = potential differences in interactions (looking for more natural receptions)
		- wording of observation
	- AKA Hawthorn Effect
	- Ex. screen recording, eye-tracking, heat map of cursor

	- not just the people, not just the software = everyone
	- check the content and problems of competitors to fix = benefits and design features 
		- competitive advantages: How does it compare to own program vs SAAS?
		- large enough company?
		- increase client trust
		- preserve organization reputation
		- maintain corporate resiliency
		- enhance organizational piece (what part of organization?)
- Questionnaires: limited or not (structured or unstructured)
	- more structured 
	- could be more of a mix
		- more efficient
	- better to be unstructured later  

- Designing a System
	- Need Documents and Specifications for what System Can Do 
	- What allows and what cannot allow
	- focus is usually on price and purposes 
	- Additional Modifications (limited)
	- Additional more than Agreed = more cost <(`^â€™)>

- Real- time processing
	- environment changing due to data processing and user input = real time
	- badge processing ~ running a script and does a bunch of stuff in one big chunk 
		- ex. working with photos - certain format/filter - can have a program that puts on filter
		- ex. sending out a photo through email and send out = number of people sent to x (times) more space of server taken up
