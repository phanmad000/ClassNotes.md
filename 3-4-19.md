## Ticket Systems
- problems: complexity vs. siimplicity  
  - how much effort is required
    due to unclear instructions, match expected and norms of internet experience
  - built in help?
    too bad, tough
    can fix by aligning with marketing and rest of tech
- efficiency: after getting used to system
  - unnecessary clicks, efficient flow through user system, unnecessary clicks?, potential errors?, wrong data and how does program respond
- learnability: how long does it take to learn and adapt
- readability: short and concise, font choice, color choice
- satisfaction of general public: find sample of end users - can never perfect test since people know they're being tested
- efficiency - how software is designed, how much is automatic or manual, how many overrides, can be done in batches or manually individual - amount of work that customer does = amount of efficiency 
  - design to the point where they are attached but not annoyed
  
  
## Types of errors
  - validation and verification - stuff going in correct areas
  - all inputs put into direct areas
  - how does machine respond     
  - payroll = how easy is it to use - how intuitive is design for use? 
  - allowing the error and nothing catches it
  - validity of memory in satisfaction rating 
  
## Scheduling 
  - how set up everybody
  - tie into calendar on phone or email = notifications
  - designed for use?
  - may have to schedule workflows and tasks, instead of people
  
## Efficiency
  - easy modifications?
  
## Moral and Ethical
  - AI - potential issues in how they affect humans
    - great since cars, clothing, farming cheaper: good
    - job market, increased unemployment: bad 
      outsourcing, visas for lower rates = old contributors to rise in unemployment
    - trying to replicate human functioning - need microchips - where and how does waste go? Pollution, especially e-waste
    - AI issues: create fake things or when does AI go past its boundary line (decreases well-paying jobs due to better work)
    - how smart it should be able to be: artificial people, artificial voices, create fake people @>
    - internet kills books - paper industry - there was no significant decrease in printed materials
    
    - for people who weren't able to have good access to technology their jobs have been taken
