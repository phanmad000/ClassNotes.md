- top-down design: how gonna solve problem  AKA step-wise refinement
- goal broken up and taken in smaller pieces
- module - part of program but can exist on own
- can modify just certain module when there is bug
- modular programming - most modern programming languages

- can get input form users through pseudocode
- prototype designs = inputs
- prototype = no function but demo or function but not perfect
- iteration - repeating things - doing something multiple times
- iteration in comp sci = loop 
- iteration in design = continuous devlopment of design
- design flow = waterfall design pattern
- spiral iteration = ?
- iterative design = better in terms of time 


Accessibility and Usability

USABILITY
- Does it work with end users?
- Does it function for what it's used for?

Problems of Usability:
- complexity vs simplicity
	- how many clicks are  needed to get to destination - subways, airports
	- dependence on memory: intuitive? of design
	
	

ACCESSIBILITY
- Can a variety of people in different situations access it?
- Does it encompass the needs of those outside norm?
- Anything discriminate anyone else with disabilities (blind, bad vision, deaf)
	ex. screen readers, good contrasting colors, zoom

Public = yes
Private = potentially not
Government requires certain accessibility requirements - especially concerning policies
(no red and green, screenreaders, grayscale everything as way of checking values)




Ergonomics ~ design a program to reduce possible health conditions/cause less strain/better support the user - ex.dark contrast, office chairs, dark mode, cushions 

- varying amounts of effectiveness/expectations depending on past experiences: speed, time, recovery
- efficiency: hand quality may be better - but take in consideration other factors
- looking for what is efficient enough and effective
- readibility: how easy is it to read: letters are easily readable but not words - words do not fit the normal shape
- comprehensibility
- legibility: font, easily distinguish between different letters
- satisfaction: customers enjoy service; limited by less competition

- ex. smartphones (buttons, touchscreen), GPS, game consoles (screen brightness and size, sound, headphone jack), carpal tunnel, RSI syndrome, brightness = eye strain, glare?, left-handed vs. right-handed mice
