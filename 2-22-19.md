- top-down design: how gonna solve problem  AKA step-wise refinement
- goal broken up and taken in smaller pieces
- module - part of program but can exist on own
- can modify just certain module when there is bug
- modular programming - most modern programming languages

- can get input form users through pseudocode
- prototype designs = inputs
- prototype = no function but demo or function but not perfect
- iteration - repeating things - doing something multiple times
- iteration in comp sci = loop 
- iteration in design = continuous devlopment of design
- design flow = waterfall design pattern
- spiral iteration = ?
- iterative design = better in terms of time 


Accessibility and Usability

USABILITY
- Does it work with end users?
- Does it function for what it's used for?

ACCESSIBILITY
- Can a variety of people in different situations access it?
- Does it encompass the needs of those outside norm?
- Anything discriminate anyone else with disabilities (blind, bad vision, deaf)
	ex. screen readers, good contrasting colors, zoom


Public = yes
Private = potentially not
Government requires certain accessibility requirements - especially concerning policies
(no red and green, screenreaders, grayscale everything as way of checking values)
